# UdacityMWS-Stage3
Mobile Web Design Stage 3 project

## How to view

This code requires that [node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) be installed. Please install these first. Additionally, this project depends on a separate project provided by Udacity to create an API end-point. This project is available on [git ](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3). Please follow the instructions there.

Once you have these dependencies installed and the API server is started, create a new folder and clone the following from https://github.com/AngieV/UdacityMWS-Stage3 : /src/, .babelrc, package.json, package-lock.json and gulpfile.babel.js

Once you have the server dependencies installed and the API server is started, do the following:

In a new terminal window, navigate to the new project folder you just created.

Run 'npm install' from the terminal to load project dependencies.

Add an empty folder 'dist' to the project folder

In the terminal run 'gulp sync' to have BrowserSync serve the app on localhost:8000 or other available port.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000 (or other available port) and explore the app.
